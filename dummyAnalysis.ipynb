    "Analyzing two weeks' worth of temperature and humidity data can provide valuable insights into weather patterns and environmental conditions. Here are some possible analyses you can perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Identify any long-term trends in temperature and humidity over the two-week period. Are they increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Daily Variations:**\n",
    "   - Examine the daily temperature and humidity patterns to see if there are any consistent variations, such as temperature highs and lows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weekly Patterns:**\n",
    "   - Look for weekly cycles or patterns. Some places experience different weather conditions on weekends compared to weekdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Descriptive Statistics:**\n",
    "   - Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum values for temperature and humidity during the two-week period.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Histograms and Distributions:**\n",
    "   - Create histograms to visualize the distribution of temperature and humidity data. Are they normally distributed or skewed?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Examine the relationship between temperature and humidity. Is there a correlation between the two variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Anomalies and Outliers:**\n",
    "   - Identify any unusual or extreme temperature or humidity values that deviate significantly from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Comparative Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Compare the data from the current two-week period to historical data to identify any anomalies or deviations from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Weather Events:**\n",
    "   - Look for patterns that might be associated with specific weather events, such as rain, storms, or heatwaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Spatial Analysis:**\n",
    "    - If you have data from multiple locations, compare temperature and humidity between those locations to analyze spatial variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Time Series Analysis:**\n",
    "    - Use time series analysis techniques to identify seasonality and cyclic patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Predictive Modeling:**\n",
    "    - Use the data to build predictive models for future temperature and humidity based on historical patterns and weather forecasts.\n",
